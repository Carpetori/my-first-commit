      <p><b>The</b> 1970 Convention on the Means of Prohibiting the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of <sub>Ownership</sub> of Cultural Property is the first international treaty that was created to <del>fight</del> against the illicit trafficking of cultural property. It presently consists of 137 state parties. The Convention urges that the protection of cultural property should be <sub>implemented</sub> in "three main pillars" namely preventive measures, <sup>restitution</sup> provision and international cooperation.
        There is also an introduction to the due diligence principle and ICOM Code of Ethics for Museums in the 1995 UNDROIT Convention on Stolen or Illegally <small>Exported</small> Cultural Objects which requires anyone purchasing any artefacts to ensure that it has been lawfully acquired.
        When discussing about <em>illicit</em> trade of cultural property at the international level, the <mark>UNESCO</mark> 1970 and UNDROIT 1995 Conventions are the most all-inclusive sources of law.There are some loopholes in the 1970 Convention which has been filled up by the <ins>UNDROIT</ins> 1995. And there also exists the Model Provisions on State Ownership of Undiscovered Cultural Objects whichwas drafted by the UNESCO and UNDROIT with a goal to assist states in drafting a coherent legislation.In addition, state parties to the 1970 Convention have agreed to prevent any transfer of cultural property likely to encourage illicit exportation, to ensure that cooperation is formed in order to return cultural property and also to acknowledge the right of state parties to announce that a certain cultural property is not subject to forfeiture.
        <strong>Peace Treaty Of Westphalia 1648 is also a very important landmark in the fight against illicit trafficking of cultural property</strong>. Article CXIV of the Treaty provides for the restitution of stolen <i>artefacts</i>.
